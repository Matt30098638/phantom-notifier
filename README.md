Here's a `README.md` file for your TMDB Recommendation Fetcher project:

```markdown
# TMDB Recommendation Fetcher

This Python project fetches movie or TV show recommendations from The Movie Database (TMDB) API. Using a title as input, it queries TMDB for recommendations based on the provided title, retrieves similar titles, and caches the results to improve performance. 

## Features

- Fetches recommendations for movies or TV shows based on a title.
- Caches recommendations to reduce redundant API calls.
- Logs API interactions and errors for easier debugging.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- TMDB API Key (needed to access TMDB services)

## Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/tmdb-recommendation-fetcher.git
cd tmdb-recommendation-fetcher
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install required packages using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **Note**: Ensure `requests` is included in `requirements.txt`.

### 3. Configure API Key

Create a `config.py` file in the root directory to store your TMDB API key.

```python
# config.py
config = {
    'tmdb': {
        'api_key': 'YOUR_TMDB_API_KEY'
    }
}
```

Replace `'YOUR_TMDB_API_KEY'` with your actual API key from [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api).

## Usage

The main classes and functions in the project are:

- **TMDBHelper**: This class interacts with the TMDB API to fetch recommendations.
- **get_tmdb_recommendations**: This function accepts a list of titles and fetches recommendations for each one.

### Example Usage

```python
from tmdb_helper import get_tmdb_recommendations

titles = ["The Matrix", "Breaking Bad"]
recommendations = get_tmdb_recommendations(titles, media_type='movie')

for title, recs in recommendations.items():
    print(f"Recommendations for '{title}':")
    for rec in recs:
        print(f" - {rec}")
```

This code will print out a list of recommended titles for each movie or TV show in `titles`.

## Logging

The script logs important events and errors to the console. Logging levels are set to `INFO`, which can be adjusted based on needs.

### Sample Log Output

```text
INFO:root:Fetching recommendations for 'The Matrix'
INFO:root:Retrieved 5 recommendations for TMDB ID 603
INFO:root:Using cached recommendations for 'The Matrix'
```

## Error Handling

- If a title is not found, the script logs a warning.
- If there's an API request error (e.g., network issues or invalid API key), the script logs an error and returns an empty list.
